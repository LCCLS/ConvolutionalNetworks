# ConvolutionalNetworks

*Two main projects*

**1. COVID X_RAY Classification**

--> here the data is first augmented to improve training and subsequently passed into a multi-classification CNN that classifies into pneumonia, 
covid, or healthy. The performance is quite variable, yet higher than chance. 

**2. galaxy classification**

--> this CNN classifies galaxies into four classes based on Hubble images. Data is again augmented to increase trainingset size and variability.
